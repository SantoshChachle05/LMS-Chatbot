# 🎓 LMS Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot tailored for Learning Management Systems (LMS), leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It enhances user queries with relevant academic or course-specific context retrieved from a knowledge base (such as lecture notes, PDFs, or LMS content), improving the relevance and accuracy of responses.

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 Natural language chat interface for LMS users (students/instructors)
- 📚 Context-aware answers using course materials
- 🔍 Semantic search with vector embeddings
- 🔗 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- 🧠 Integrates with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers)
- 🗂️ Vector store (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone) for efficient retrieval
- 🔐 Optional authentication for secure usage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language Model**: OpenAI GPT / Hugging Face models
- **RAG Backend**: LangChain / Haystack
- **Vector Store**: FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone
- **Frontend**: Streamlit / Gradio / Web-based chat UI
- **Framework**: Python (FastAPI or Flask for API)
- **Data Sources**: PDFs, DOCs, or LMS exports

Set up your environment variables in a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
VECTOR_DB_PATH=path_to_vectorstore

▶️ Running the App
python app.py


or for Streamlit UI:

streamlit run frontend/app.py

🧠 How It Works

Ingestion: Course materials are chunked and embedded using a transformer model.

Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database.

Retrieval: User query is embedded and matched with relevant context.

Generation: The LLM generates a response conditioned on the retrieved context.

🔐 Security & Access

You can integrate user-level permissions or token-based access to protect course data, especially in production LMS environments.

📌 Future Improvements

Integration with Moodle / Canvas LMS APIs

Multi-user sessions with context tracking

PDF/Document upload via UI

Whisper for voice input

Grading assistant module (Auto-QA)
